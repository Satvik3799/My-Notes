2. Only the number which is a perfect square, will have odd no of factors.
	for ex. 
	9 -----> (1,9), (3,3) ------> 1 3 9
		At round 1 3 and 9, the coin no. 9 will be flipped. 
	8 -----> (1,8), (2,4) ------> 1 2 4 8
		At round 1 2 4 and 8, the coin no. 8 will be flipped. 
	16 -----> (1,16) (2, 8) (4, 4) ------> 1 2 4 8 16
		At round 1 2 4 8 and 16, the coin no. 16 will be flipped. 
	Initially all coin were flipped to T. That was round no. 1
	Now, the 9th coin will be flipped two times. T(1) --> H(3) --> T (9)
	8th coin. T(1) ---> H(2) --> T(4) --> H (8)
	So only the numbers will perfecr cube will stay tails up.
