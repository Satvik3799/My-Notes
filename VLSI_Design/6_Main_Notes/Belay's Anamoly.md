## TLDR:
**Belady's Anomaly** is when adding more memory (page frames) in a FIFO page replacement algorithm unexpectedly increases page faults instead of reducing them. This counterintuitive issue shows that more memory doesnâ€™t always mean better performance with certain algorithms.

------------------------------------------------------------------------ -

Belady's Anomaly refers to a counterintuitive phenomenon in computer science, particularly in **page replacement algorithms** used in virtual memory management. It describes the situation where, as the number of page frames (or memory slots) allocated to a program increases, the **number of page faults** (instances where a needed page is not in memory) can also increase.

This anomaly is surprising because we usually expect that adding more memory should improve performance by reducing page faults. However, Belady's Anomaly demonstrates that this is not always the case, especially with certain page replacement algorithms.

### Key Points:

- **Belady's Anomaly** is primarily observed in **FIFO (First-In-First-Out)** page replacement algorithms.
- It shows that simply increasing the number of frames does not guarantee a reduction in page faults.
- This anomaly does not occur with some other algorithms, like **LRU (Least Recently Used)** or **OPT (Optimal Page Replacement)**, which are not prone to this anomaly.

### Example:

Consider a reference string (sequence of page requests) and a fixed set of page frames. Using FIFO, as more frames are added, one might still experience an increase in page faults due to the way FIFO evicts pages.

Belady's Anomaly highlights the importance of choosing efficient page replacement algorithms to optimize memory management, as more resources don't always lead to better performance with certain strategies.
