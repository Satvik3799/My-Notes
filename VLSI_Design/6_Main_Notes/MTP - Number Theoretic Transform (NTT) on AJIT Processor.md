### Introduction

I’ve been working on optimizing the **Number Theoretic Transform (NTT)** for cryptographic applications, specifically implementing it on the **AJIT Processor** developed at IIT Bombay. My project focuses on hardware-software co-design for the NTT, with applications in post-quantum cryptography and secure computation methods like **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**.


### Conclusion

In summary, my project demonstrates how architectural choices—like dual-threading and modular components—make the AJIT processor highly suitable for computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms. By implementing NTT on both single- and dual-thread configurations, I’ve achieved a solution that not only meets the demands of post-quantum cryptography but also highlights the value of the AJIT processor in high-performance embedded applications.
