## Delayed Branch Execution in SPARC: NPC and NNPC

In SPARC architecture, branch delay execution is handled using two registers, the *Next Program Counter* (NPC) and *Next Next Program Counter* (NNPC). This allows for efficient branch instruction handling by leveraging delayed branch execution.

### 1. Program Counter (PC), NPC, and NNPC
- **PC (Program Counter):** Holds the address of the current instruction.
- **NPC (Next Program Counter):** Holds the address of the instruction that will be executed next.
- **NNPC (Next Next Program Counter):** Holds the address of the instruction to be executed after NPC. It’s used to handle delayed branches efficiently.

### 2. Delayed Branch Execution
- In SPARC, branches are *delayed*, meaning that after a branch instruction, the next instruction is **still executed** before the branch takes effect. This approach minimizes pipeline stalls.
- **NPC and NNPC** help manage this by storing the next two instruction addresses:
  - When a branch is taken, the branch target address goes into the NPC, while the address of the instruction following the branch goes into the NNPC. This allows the branch to be executed smoothly after the delay slot instruction is processed.

### 3. Branch Delay Slot
- The instruction immediately following a branch is called the *delay slot*.
- SPARC’s pipeline continues to execute the instruction in the delay slot while the branch is resolved.

### 4. Example of Delayed Branch Execution

```assembly
100:  ADD %r1, %r2, %r3
104:  BEQ target  ! Branch if equal
108:  NOP         ! Delay slot (No operation)
200:  target: ...
```


Consider a sequence where the Program Counter (PC) points to an instruction. After this, the branch instruction is fetched into the NPC, and the delay slot instruction is fetched into the NNPC. Even when the branch is taken, the delay slot instruction is still executed before control is transferred to the branch target.

- The **PC** points to the current instruction.
- The **NPC** holds the branch instruction.
- The **NNPC** contains the instruction in the delay slot.

Once the delay slot instruction is executed, the **PC** updates to the branch target, and the **NPC** updates to the next instruction after the branch.

### Summary:
- **NPC** and **NNPC** optimize branch instruction handling by utilizing a delayed branch execution model.
- The **branch delay slot** ensures that at least one instruction after the branch is executed, reducing pipeline stalls and improving efficiency.

This delayed branching with NPC and NNPC improves performance by keeping the pipeline full, ensuring smooth execution of branch instructions without immediate disruptions.
