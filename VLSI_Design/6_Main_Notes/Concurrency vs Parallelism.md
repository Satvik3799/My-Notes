**Concurrency** and **parallelism** are both related to executing multiple tasks, but they represent different approaches to multitasking:

---

### 1. Concurrency

- **Definition**: Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to manage multiple tasks by switching between them. It doesn’t necessarily mean tasks are being executed at the exact same time; instead, it means tasks are managed so that multiple tasks _appear_ to progress simultaneously.
    
- **Execution**: In concurrent systems, a single core or processor may switch between multiple tasks very quickly (often called context switching). Each task gets a small slice of CPU time, creating the illusion that the tasks are running simultaneously.
    
- **Use Case**: Concurrency is useful for handling tasks that involve waiting (e.g., waiting for I/O operations like reading from a file or a network). By switching to other tasks while waiting, the system uses resources more efficiently.
    
- **Example**: A single-core system running a web server uses concurrency to handle multiple user requests. When it has to wait for a database query, it can switch to handle another user’s request in the meantime.

### 2. Parallelism

- **Definition**: Parallelism is when multiple tasks or parts of a task are executed _literally at the same time_ on multiple cores or processors. It requires actual simultaneous execution of tasks.
    
- **Execution**: In parallelism, each task (or part of a task) runs on its own core, processor, or thread, without needing to share CPU time. This is real multitasking because the tasks don’t interrupt each other and run concurrently in a literal sense.
    
- **Use Case**: Parallelism is ideal for tasks that can be divided into independent sub-tasks. It’s frequently used in high-performance computing, data processing, and scientific simulations where workloads can be split and processed in parallel.
    
- **Example**: A quad-core processor performing image processing on different sections of an image, where each core processes a part independently.

### Summary of Differences

|Aspect|Concurrency|Parallelism|
|---|---|---|
|**Execution method**|Task switching between multiple tasks|Simultaneous execution of tasks on multiple cores|
|**Hardware needed**|Can occur on a single-core processor|Requires multiple cores or processors|
|**Use case**|Managing tasks with waiting periods|Performing independent sub-tasks simultaneously|
|**Example**|Handling multiple I/O requests in a web server|Processing large datasets by dividing tasks|

### Analogy

- **Concurrency** is like a single cashier quickly switching between customers, taking a bit of each customer’s order at a time.
- **Parallelism** is like having multiple cashiers serving multiple customers at the same time, each independently handling a different customer.

### Key Insight

Concurrency is about the _structure_ of handling multiple tasks, while parallelism is about the _actual execution_ of multiple tasks at the same time. Concurrency can make a single-core processor seem like it's handling multiple tasks, while parallelism requires multiple cores or processors to achieve true simultaneous task execution.
