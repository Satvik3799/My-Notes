NTT is used to do polynomial multiplication in $O(nlog(n))$ time complexity, which is a good improvement over $O(n^2)$. NTT converts the polynomial into point wise representation of the polynomial and from then we can do point wise multiplication and then the result, which will be again in the point wise form, will be converted back to the original polynomial form using Inverse NTT.
