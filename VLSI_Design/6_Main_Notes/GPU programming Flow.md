## General Flow to Execute Code on GPU

1. Set Up Data on Host (CPU):  \

   Prepare your data on the CPU. This includes any input arrays or variables that will be processed by the GPU.

2. Allocate Memory on the Device (GPU):  \

   CUDA uses device memory, and you need to allocate space for the input and output data on the GPU.

3. Copy Data from Host to Device:  \

4. After allocating memory on the GPU, you need to copy the data from the CPU (host) to the GPU (device) using cudaMemcpy.

  

5. Define CUDA Kernel: \

A kernel is a function that runs on the GPU. It is marked with ```__global__```. Each thread in the GPU will run this kernel, and the kernel can be designed to perform operations in parallel on large datasets.

  

6. Launch the Kernel: \

The kernel is executed by specifying the number of threads and blocks. Each thread will work on a part of the dataset. The kernel is launched asynchronously to the CPU, meaning the CPU continues executing while the GPU works in parallel.

  

7. Synchronize the Device: \

After launching the kernel, ensure that the GPU finishes its work before the CPU proceeds. This is done using cudaDeviceSynchronize() or using events to measure the time taken by the GPU.

  

8. Copy the Results from Device to Host: \

After the GPU has completed the operation, you need to copy the results back to the host (CPU) memory for further processing or output.

  

9. Free Device Memory: \

Once you're done with the GPU memory, free it using cudaFree

  
  

## CUDA Kernel Launch

In CUDA, kernels are functions that run on the GPU in parallel. When you launch a kernel, the GPU will execute the function on many threads simultaneously, with each thread working on a part of the data.

  

Here’s how the kernel launch works and what we need to understand about the parameters:

  

1. Kernel Function (```addArraysGPU```):

The kernel is defined using the ```__global__``` keyword, which tells the compiler that this function will be executed on the GPU. In your case:

  

```

__global__ void addArraysGPU(int* a, int* b, int* c, int n) {

    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;

    if (idx < n) {

        c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];

    }

}

```

  

The addArraysGPU function will be executed by multiple threads in parallel. Here's the key part of the kernel:

  

threadIdx.x: This gives the thread index within a block. Each block of threads has its own local index.

blockIdx.x: This provides the block index. CUDA divides the total number of threads into blocks, and each block has a block index.

blockDim.x: This tells us the number of threads per block along the x-axis.

The formula ````idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x``` calculates a unique index for each thread across all blocks.

  

The threads execute this kernel in parallel, and each thread performs the addition of two corresponding array elements: ```a[idx] + b[idx]```, storing the result in ```c[idx]```.

  

2. Thread Configuration (Execution Configuration):

When launching the kernel, you need to specify how many threads to run and how to organize them into blocks. This is done using the following syntax:

```

addArraysGPU<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, N);

```

Here: ```<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>``` is the execution configuration where:

blocksPerGrid: The number of blocks in the grid.

threadsPerBlock: The number of threads in each block.

Let’s dive deeper into how this configuration works.

  

3. Threads and Blocks:

In CUDA, you are working with a grid of blocks, and each block consists of multiple threads. This allows for parallel execution of your kernel.

  

Threads: These are the smallest units of execution. Each thread executes the kernel function (in this case, addArraysGPU).

Blocks: Threads are grouped together into blocks. Each block can have a different number of threads, but the maximum number of threads per block depends on the GPU architecture (typically, 1024 threads per block).

Grid: A grid is a collection of blocks. The grid dimensions depend on how many blocks you need to cover all the threads required for the problem.

  

4. Threads per Block (threadsPerBlock):

In your case, you specify:

```int threadsPerBlock = 256;```

  

This means there will be 256 threads per block. Each of these threads will execute the kernel function, with each thread working on a unique element of the arrays. So, for the addition of two arrays, each thread adds a pair of elements from a and b.

  

5. Blocks per Grid (```blocksPerGrid```):

To calculate the number of blocks required to process all the elements, we use:

  

```

int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

```

Here’s what this formula does:

  

N: Total number of elements to process.

threadsPerBlock: The number of threads in each block.

The formula ensures that the total number of blocks is enough to cover all elements. The (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) ensures that we round up in case N is not perfectly divisible by threadsPerBlock.

For example, if N = 1,000,000 and threadsPerBlock = 256, the number of blocks would be:

  

```

blocksPerGrid = (1,000,000 + 256 - 1) / 256 = 3907 blocks

```

So, we have 3907 blocks of 256 threads each.

  

6. Kernel Launch:

Now, when you call:

  

```addArraysGPU<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_a, d_b, d_c, N);

```

  

This will launch:

  

- blocksPerGrid blocks: In the example, this would be 3907 blocks.

- Each block contains threadsPerBlock threads: Each block will have 256 threads.

- Each thread adds corresponding elements of arrays a and b: Each thread performs an operation on one element, ```c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx]```.

  

The number of threads is parallelized, meaning the computation for each element of the arrays happens concurrently. Each thread will be executed on a different CUDA core on the GPU, leveraging its massive parallel processing power.

  

7. Launching in Parallel:

-The threads within each block run in parallel.

-The blocks themselves run in parallel across multiple multiprocessors (SMs) on the GPU.

-The total number of threads created by blocksPerGrid * threadsPerBlock will determine how many CUDA cores on the GPU are being utilized for the task.

  

8. Asynchronous Execution:

-Once the kernel is launched, the CPU doesn’t wait for the GPU to finish. The CPU continues executing the next instructions.

-However, if you need to ensure that the CPU waits for the GPU to finish (e.g., to get the results back from the GPU), you use cudaDeviceSynchronize().

  

### Summary of the Kernel Launch Process:

- Define the Kernel: Create the CUDA kernel function that will be executed in parallel on the GPU.

- Configure the Number of Threads and Blocks: Decide how many threads per block and how many blocks per grid.

- Launch the Kernel: Use the ````<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>```` syntax to launch the kernel. The GPU will launch the kernel in parallel across the blocks and threads.

- Synchronize (Optional): Use cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure the CPU waits for the GPU to finish.

  

This process allows you to execute tasks in parallel on the GPU, speeding up operations that can be parallelized, such as array manipulations, matrix operations, and more.
