1. Static variable- Retains value across function calls (in a function) or is shared among all class instances (in a class).
2. Static Function - Belongs to the class rather than an object, and can only access static members (in a class), or has internal linkage limiting its visibility to the file (outside a class).
3. Fundamental Period of a continuous signal -$T = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}$
4. The theoretical stuff of defining a processor's specification, its ISA, no. of bits for memory and instruction etc, is Computer Architecture and Its actual implementation by deciding the memory structures and its size etc is Computer Organization.
5. Small Scale Integration (SSI) - 1 to 10, 
	 Medium Scale integration (MSI) - 10 to 1000,
	 Large Scale Integration (LSI) - 1000 to 10000,
	 VLSI - 10k 
	 ULSI - Billions
5. Convolution
