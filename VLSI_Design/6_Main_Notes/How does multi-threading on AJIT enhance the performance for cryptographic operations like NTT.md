NTT is similar to FFT. The algorithm relies on dissecting the array into even and odd indices or indices based on the generated twiddle factors. I can do the computations on those arrays separately. So the Dual thread flavour of the AJIT processor would help me in this regard. So I thought, but it ended up giving me worse than single thread processor. I had shown the code to my co-guide, prof. Madhav Desai, and he has suggested some changes I could do to improve it. He mentioned that the code has data dependencies between the threads so most likely the issue is Cache coherency. But It is not of any concern now, because he has shown an implementation of the FFT on AJIT processor which has led to twice the speed-up. I will focus on that implementation and improve my code in the upcoming weeks.
