## Question (Deadlock)
Deadlock : A deadlock is a situation where a set of processes is blocked because each process is holding a resource and waiting for another resource acquired by some other process.

A deadlock can be dealt with by 4 methods:
	1. Preemptation - if the process takes more time to run, then remove it.
	2. Remove mutexes - the data will be lost when other process uses the shared resource, but deadlock will never occur.
	3. Hold and Wait - Hold the other processes, and let the entire process it self finish before releasing resources. 
	4. e


## Question (BJT)
The **Early effect** is a phenomenon that occurs in a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) when the base's effective width changes due to variations in the base-to-collector voltage. It's also known as base width modulation or effective-base-width modulation.


## Question(I/O)
Which of the following is the correct sequence of operations in a microprocessor? I/O read, opcode fetch, memory write, memory read, I/O write Opcode fetch, memory write, memory read, I/O read, I/O write Opcode fetch, memory read, memory write, I/O read, I/O write 1/0 read, opcode fetch, memory read, memory write, I/O write
#### ChatGPT said:

The correct sequence of operations in a microprocessor is:

**Opcode fetch, memory read, memory write, I/O read, I/O write**

This sequence reflects the general flow of operations in a typical instruction cycle:

1. **Opcode fetch**: The microprocessor fetches the opcode from memory, which tells it what instruction to execute.
2. **Memory read**: If the instruction requires reading data from memory, this step is performed.
3. **Memory write**: If the instruction involves writing data to memory, this step occurs next.
4. **I/O read**: If the instruction requires reading data from an I/O device, this step follows.
5. **I/O write**: Finally, if the instruction involves writing data to an I/O device, this step is performed.

So, the correct answer is:

**Opcode fetch, memory read, memory write, I/O read, I/O write**
