**Answer:** The number of links that will change when deleting a node in a circular linked list depends on the location of the element being deleted. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Deleting the Head Node**: If you delete the head (first) node, you typically need to update the link of the last node to point to the new head (the node after the current head), and then update the head pointer. This requires 2 links to change.

2. **Deleting the Tail Node**: If you delete the last node, you need to update the link of the node just before it to point to the head node. This also requires 2 links to change.

3. **Deleting a Middle Node**: If you delete any middle node, only the link of the previous node needs to be updated to point to the next node, so only 1 link change is required.

In general, the number of links that will change is usually 1 or 2, depending on the location of the node to be deleted.

So, the correct answer is: **Depends on the location of the element.**
