1. Why Gray code in Async FIFO? Why multi-bit synchronisation doesn't work?
2. [[Difference between Sync and Async Counters. Which is better and STA of sync and Async counters]]
3. Verilog event queue - Blocking nonBlocking.
4. IEEE floating point representation.
5. Integer frequency division with Sync and Async counters.
6. Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) - Kuruvilla Varghese (IISc)
7. Gray code coutners, Arbitary Gray code coutners.
8. Thoughput units MFLOPS, MIPS etc
