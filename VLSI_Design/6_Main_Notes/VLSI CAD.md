### Step 1: Understanding Power Consumption Components
Power consumption in a digital circuit can be divided into two main components:
- **Dynamic Power Consumption (P_dyn):** This occurs when signals toggle (i.e., when the circuit switches states).
  $$P_{\text{dyn}} = C_{\text{load}} \times V_{\text{dd}}^2 \times f \times \alpha $$$
  where:
  - \(C_{\text{load}}\) = load capacitance,
  - \(V_{\text{dd}}\) = supply voltage,
  - \(f\) = clock frequency,
  - \(\alpha\) = activity factor (fraction of the circuit that switches).
  
- **Static Power Consumption (P_static):** This occurs due to leakage current even when the circuit is not switching.
  $$  P_{\text{static}} = I_{\text{leak}} \times V_{\text{dd}}
  $$
  where \(I_{\text{leak}}\) is the leakage current.

### Step 2: Analyzing Dynamic Power Consumption
For dynamic power, you would calculate how much switching happens during the execution of your datapath. In the given DFG, the execution involves:
- **One multiplier** and **one adder** performing operations sequentially. The power consumption depends on the number of operations, the switching activity of the signals, and how many registers are used.

You need to assess:
- The **number of toggles** in the circuit (for the datapath, this would be the total number of operations that involve changes in signal values).
- The **frequency** at which the circuit operates (you may reuse the frequency from your earlier FSM calculation).
- The **load capacitance** for each operation, which is usually technology-dependent (it would depend on the multiplier, adder, and registers used).

### Step 3: Analyzing Static Power Consumption
Static power depends on the leakage currents in the transistors, which is determined by the technology you're using (e.g., 45nm, 28nm). This power is always consumed, even when the circuit is idle.

### Step 4: Calculate Power Efficiency
Power efficiency is the **ratio of actual power consumption to the required power**:
$$
\text{Power Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Minimum Required Power Consumption}}{\text{Actual Power Consumption}}
$$
- **Minimum required power consumption** can be thought of as the minimum power needed to perform the required operations if no unnecessary switching or leakage occurred. In ideal conditions, it would only include the power consumed by the exact number of necessary operations.
- **Actual power consumption** includes both the dynamic and static power losses in the circuit.

### Step 5: Power Optimization Techniques (for Improved Efficiency)
- **Clock gating**: Disable the clock to parts of the circuit that are not currently needed to reduce dynamic power.
- **Voltage scaling**: Use the lowest possible supply voltage to reduce both dynamic and static power.
- **Minimize switching activity**: Reduce unnecessary toggling of signals.
  
### Example Application to Your Question
- Apply the **left-edge algorithm** to bind registers to variables efficiently, minimizing the number of active registers at a time to reduce unnecessary switching.
- **Datapath design**: Draw a schematic for the datapath, showing how the multiplier and adder are used at different times, with the appropriate registers connected based on the algorithm.
  
Finally, calculate the **actual power** by summing dynamic and static components, and compute the efficiency ratio as per the formula above. If actual values for capacitance and leakage are not provided, assume reasonable values based on the technology node in use.

### Step 1: Understanding the Input Stream (5 μs)
The 5 μs refers to the **time interval** in which the primary inputs (`a, b, c, d, e, h`) are made available as a stream. This means that every 5 microseconds, new data for the inputs will be available for processing. This time interval will guide the design of the state machine, as it dictates the rate at which the inputs must be processed.

### Step 2: Identifying the Time Steps (Pipeline Stages)
From the Data Flow Graph (DFG) in the image:
- **Time 1:** Two operations (multiplication and addition) are happening concurrently.
- **Time 2:** Two additions are performed.
- **Time 3:** One final addition.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Time for Execution
Since the operations are divided across 3 time steps:
- Each time step must be completed in **5 μs** (the interval of input availability). 
- The total time for execution is:
  \[
  T_{\text{total}} = 3 \times 5 \text{ μs} = 15 \text{ μs}
  \]

### Step 4: Minimum Frequency Calculation
The frequency of operation is the **inverse of the total execution time** for each cycle. Since the operations are completed every 15 μs:
\[
\text{Minimum Frequency} = \frac{1}{T_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{15 \text{ μs}} = \frac{1}{15 \times 10^{-6}} \text{ seconds}
\]
\[
\text{Minimum Frequency} = 66.67 \text{ kHz}
\]

Thus, the minimum frequency of operation for the state machine should be **66.67 kHz** to process the inputs in real-time within the 5 μs input stream interval.
