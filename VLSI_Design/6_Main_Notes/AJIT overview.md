## AJIT Processor core: ASIC history
A proof-of-concept implementation in 180nm technology was carried out at SCL
Chandigarh.
• 7mm X 7mm, 144 functional I/O’s, 256 pin package.
• 0.5 W at 66 MHz (slow corner).
An implementation of the AJIT processor core for a NAVIC GPS+IRNSS
receiver system-on-chip has been fabricated in 65nm technology at UMC (Tai-
wan). The SOC is completely functional based on first silicon testing.
• The total area of the SOC is 4mm X 4mm (56 I/O, 100 total pads). The
are occupied by the CPU is 1mm X 1mm.14
CHAPTER 1. AJIT PROCESSOR FAMILY
• The CPU can run at 500MHz, but the overall system is operated at 125
MHz with 512KB of single-cycle SRAM being in the critical path.
• System power dissipation is 250mW @ 125MHz. Out of this, the processor
power dissipation is 50mW.
