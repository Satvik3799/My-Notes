My name is Satvik Patel from Gujarat. I have 1 year of experience as an Embedded Hardware Design Engineer in a start-up, focusing on PCB design and debugging for Smart Home products with ESP32 microcontrollers. My job experience fueled my interest in rebuilding electronics, I have my own soldering kit, multi-meter, screwdriver bits of different type and size. I also like any sports that I can play. Specifically I am good at Cricket, badminton, Tabel tennis and have represented my b.tech college in these sports. I also like computer games, they give me a perspective I never had. Like, I used to play counter-strike a lot, and I believe it has helped me grow a lot in terms of dealing with a situation calmy and playing my cards at the right time with good aim skills.

Outside of work, I’m like sports. I am good at playing cricket, badminton, and table tennis, representing my college during my B.Tech days. I also enjoy computer games, particularly Counter-Strike, which has taught me to stay calm under pressure, strategize effectively, and execute with precision.

Being a start-up company sometimes I had to do everything on my own, like Ordering components, Soldering PCBs, 3D printing cover boxes. I have also done some freelance projects for the company, that was its 2nd source of revenue. I have Reverse engineer some products, to integrate with our own. I really enjoyed doing all that, it allowed me to learn from very diverse set of people. I have also gone to some houses to inspect the products that needed debugging and engage with the customers for feedback.
