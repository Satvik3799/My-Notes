The main reason of using the AJIT processor is that we have the main VHDL source code. The end goal is that, a processor system with a built-in NTT module, not as a peripheral but as a part of the processor itself. This system should be able to run any PQC algorithm. I don't think I can name the organisation from which the requirements are but the main design requirement is security, and not power or speed. Since we have everything related to the processor with us, AJIT processor is chosen and since it has shown some good potential in being implemented as an Embedded processor in NAVIC GPS+IRNSS receiver SoC. So after we strip away every unnecessary things, like scratch pads peripherals and some other stuff, we want to keep only what's needed and keep the NTT module.
