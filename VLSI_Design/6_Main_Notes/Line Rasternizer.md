# Line Rasterization FSM: Verilog Code Explanation

## Overview
This Verilog code implements a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** for line rasterization. It processes input coordinates \((x_0, y_0)\) and \((x_1, y_1)\) to calculate a series of rasterized points for rendering lines. The FSM transitions through defined states to compute and output rasterized data, using **Bresenham's line algorithm** for efficiency.

### Key Features:
1. **Inputs**:
   - `x0, y0, x1, y1`: Input coordinates of the line endpoints.
   - `CLOCK_50`: Clock signal for synchronous operations.
   - `start`: Control signal to start rasterization.
   - `proj_fin`: Indicates when projection calculations are finished.
   - `readFIFO`: Control signal to read from FIFO buffer.

2. **Outputs**:
   - `is_done`: Indicates completion of rasterization.
   - `outputFIFO`: Stores the rasterized coordinates.
   - `fifoSize`: Tracks the size of the FIFO buffer.
   - `is_calculating`: Signals whether calculations are ongoing.

3. **Registers**:
   - Various registers (`minX`, `maxX`, `minY`, etc.) store intermediate calculations like slopes, differences, and boundaries.

4. **FSM States**:
   - The FSM uses a set of **states** defined as `localparam` constants.

## FSM States and Their Functions
The FSM includes the following states:

### 1. **INITIAL (8'd0)**
   - **Purpose**: Sets up the initial conditions for rasterization.
   - **Actions**:
     - Resets registers to default values.
     - Waits for the `start` signal to move to the `BEGIN` state.

### 2. **BEGIN (8'd1)**
   - **Purpose**: Prepares for calculations.
   - **Actions**:
     - Initializes differences (`dx` and `dy`) between the endpoints.
     - Sets up conditions for positive or negative slope determination.

### 3. **S1 (8'd2)**
   - **Purpose**: Calculates the starting pixel position.
   - **Actions**:
     - Sets initial values for Bresenham's decision variable (`p`).
     - Determines whether the line is steep or shallow.

### 4. **S2 (8'd3)**
   - **Purpose**: Handles line rasterization for a "shallow slope."
   - **Actions**:
     - Increments or decrements `x` and updates `y` based on `p`.
     - Adjusts `p` to determine the next pixel.

### 5. **S3 (8'd4)**
   - **Purpose**: Handles line rasterization for a "steep slope."
   - **Actions**:
     - Increments or decrements `y` and updates `x` based on `p`.
     - Adjusts `p` to determine the next pixel.

### 6. **S4 (8'd5)**
   - **Purpose**: Finalizes calculations for the current segment.
   - **Actions**:
     - Stores the calculated coordinate into `outputFIFO`.

### 7. **DONE (8'd6)**
   - **Purpose**: Indicates that rasterization is complete.
   - **Actions**:
     - Sets `is_done` to `1`.
     - Waits for `readFIFO` to process output data.

### 8. **WAIT1 (8'd7) and WAIT2 (8'd8)**
   - **Purpose**: Adds delay cycles for synchronization.
   - **Actions**:
     - Ensures stable outputs before transitioning to the next state.

### 9. **T1 (8'd9), T2 (8'd10), T3 (8'd11), T4 (8'd12)**
   - **Purpose**: Intermediate states for handling specific calculations or transitions.
   - **Actions**:
     - Handles auxiliary tasks like checking edge conditions or FIFO writes.

### 10. **clear_calc (8'd13)**
   - **Purpose**: Resets calculation-related flags.
   - **Actions**:
     - Clears intermediate variables and prepares for a new rasterization session.

## State Transitions
### Transition Logic:
- Controlled by the **`Next_state`** variable, which is updated based on:
  - Input signals (`start`, `proj_fin`, etc.).
  - Current state and intermediate calculation results (e.g., slope determination).

### Transition Example:
```verilog
always @(posedge CLOCK_50) begin
    if (start) begin
        State <= BEGIN; // Transition from INITIAL to BEGIN
    end else if (State == S1) begin
        if (condition_met)
            State <= S2; // Move to the next state
        else
            State <= S3; // Alternate path
    end
end
