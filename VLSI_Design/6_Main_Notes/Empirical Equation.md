 physical phenomena is too complicated to be turned into an equation, such an equation is used.
We include one parameter in the new equation, whose value do not define a physical thing. We derive its value by doing multiple tests after manufacturing a device, and then noting the test results and then we use its value.

It simplifies the equation, but it does not guarantee scalability for all conditions outside the test conditions used for the calculation of that empirical parameter.
