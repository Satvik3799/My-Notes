So the ideal end goal is to have a processor system with built-in NTT module, that is specifically designed to encrypt and decrypt the information only. If it works, we should be able to perform encryption using FHE method. Suppose, we do a google query on a browser. Right now the google servers can know what we are searching about, but with a processor system like this. The servers, the End point clients must have these capabilities. So, the encrypted information would be sent to the cloud, the google servers. Then the server side will do whatever processing it needs to do and send again the encrypted information and the end point client will decrypt it. So without the servers knowing what we searched for, we can get the required results. 

Another example would be,
If in a company, the HR wants to do something related to Emplyees salary or something. Without knowing what is the compensation package of the Employee they can add % of bonus or deduct if it is allowed. The point is, any Add or multiplication operation can be done while in the encrypted form and the result would be intact.
