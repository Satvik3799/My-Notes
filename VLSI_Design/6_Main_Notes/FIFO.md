Interview questions:

1. In a synchronous FIFO, how would you design for worst-case scenarios, such as simultaneous read and write operations What pessimistic strategies would you apply
3. [[Discuss the implications of FIFO depth on performance. How does depth affect throughput and latency in both synchronous and asynchronous designs]]
4. Describe how you would implement error detection and recovery mechanisms in an asynchronous FIFO. What would you do if an error is detected

# Full and Empty conditions
#### Synchronous FIFO
- **Full Condition**: 
  $$ (wptr + 1) \mod \text{FIFO Depth} = rptr $$
- **Empty Condition**: 
  $$ wptr = rptr $$

#### Asynchronous FIFO
- **Full Condition**: 
  $$ wptr \text{ (synchronized)} == rptr \text{ (synchronized)} \text{ and } wptr \text{ (MSB)} \neq rptr \text{ (MSB)} $$
- **Empty Condition**: 
  $$ wptr \text{ (synchronized)} == rptr \text{ (synchronized)} $$

# Recovery Mechanisms

#### A. **Re-requesting Data**

- **Request Signal**:
    - If a read operation detects an error (e.g., due to a bad checksum), send a request signal back to the sender to re-transmit the data.
    - Example:
        
        `if (error_detected) begin    request_retransmit <= 1; end`
        

#### B. **Flushing the FIFO**

- **Flush Condition**:
    - If meta-stability leads to persistent errors, implement a flush mechanism to clear the FIFO and reset pointers. This can be triggered by a watchdog timer or a specific error condition.
    - Example:    
        `if (flush_condition) begin     read_pointer <= 0;     write_pointer <= 0;     // Clear data memory end`

# Latency and Thoughput
# FIFO Throughput and Latency Calculation

## **1. Definitions**
- **Throughput:** Number of bits processed per second.
- **Latency:** Time taken for data to pass through the FIFO from input to output.
## **2. Given Parameters**
- **Write frequency:** 100 MHz  
- **Read frequency:** 50 MHz  
- **Burst size:** 32 (number of words per burst)  
- **Depth:** 16 (number of FIFO slots)  
- **Word width (assumed):** 32 bits  

---

## **3. Throughput Calculation**
Throughput depends on the read frequency, as it determines how much data is extracted from the FIFO.

$$
\text{Throughput (bits/second)} = \text{Read frequency} \times \text{Word width} \times \text{Burst size}
$$

Assuming a **32-bit word width**:

$$
\text{Throughput} = 50 \, \text{MHz} \times 32 \, \text{bits/word} \times 32 \, \text{words/burst}
$$

$$
\text{Throughput} = 50 \times 10^6 \times 32 \times 32 = 51.2 \, \text{Gbps}
$$

---

## **4. Latency Calculation**
The latency in a FIFO is typically dominated by its depth and write speed. Data must travel through all 16 slots of the FIFO.

$$
\text{Latency (seconds)} = \text{FIFO depth} \times \frac{1}{\text{Write frequency}}
$$

$$
\text{Latency} = 16 \times \frac{1}{100 \, \text{MHz}} = 16 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{seconds}
$$

$$
\text{Latency} = 160 \, \text{ns}
$$

---

## **Summary**
- **Throughput:** $$51.2 \, \text{Gbps}$$ (assuming 32-bit word width)  
- **Latency:** $$160 \, \text{ns}$$
