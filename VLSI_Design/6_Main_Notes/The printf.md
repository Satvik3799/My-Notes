C programming offers direct memory access, which, if misused, can lead to severe security vulnerabilities. One classic attack is _function hijacking_, where a function like `printf` is redirected to execute malicious code.
---
### Example Scenario: Hijacking `printf`

Suppose we have a C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet();
    return 0;
}
```

An attacker could exploit this program by overwriting the return address of the `printf` function or altering its function pointer in memory.

### How `printf` Works with the Stack

1. **Stack Frame Setup**: When `printf` is called, the system pushes the return address (where execution should continue after `printf`) onto the stack, followed by function arguments like the format string.
2. **Execution**: `printf` accesses the arguments using the stack pointer (or specific CPU registers, depending on the ABI).
3. **Stack Cleanup**: After execution, `printf` cleans its stack frame and resumes execution from the return address.

If an attacker can overwrite the return address or a function pointer used by `printf`, they can redirect execution to malicious code.

### Overwriting `printf` with Malicious Code

#### Malicious Redirection via Buffer Overflow

Consider a vulnerable C program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

char buffer[64]; // Small buffer

void secret_function() {
    printf("You've been hacked!\n");
}

int main() {
    printf("Enter your input: ");
    gets(buffer); // Vulnerable function
    printf("You entered: %s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}
```

1. **Setup**: The `gets(buffer)` function does not check the input size, allowing attackers to overwrite memory beyond `buffer`.
2. **Exploit**: An attacker crafts input to:
    - Fill `buffer`.
    - Overwrite the return address of `main()` with the address of `secret_function`.
3. **Result**: When `main()` attempts to return, control is transferred to `secret_function`.

#### Changing `printf` Function Pointer

In more advanced attacks:

1. Locate the Global Offset Table (GOT) or other memory areas where `printf`'s address is stored.
2. Overwrite this address with the location of malicious code.
3. Next time `printf` is called, the program executes the malicious code instead.

### Demonstrating the Danger

1. Compile with no stack protection:
    
    ```bash
    gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -o vulnerable vulnerable.c
    ```
    
2. Use tools like `gdb` to analyze stack memory and craft exploit payloads.
3. Inject shellcode or redirect execution to `secret_function`.

### Conclusion

This example highlights how improper memory handling, like using `gets()`, can lead to vulnerabilities. Key practices to mitigate such issues include:

- Using safe functions (`fgets()` instead of `gets()`).
- Enabling compiler protections (stack canaries, non-executable stacks).
- Writing secure code with bounds-checking and modern memory-safe languages.
