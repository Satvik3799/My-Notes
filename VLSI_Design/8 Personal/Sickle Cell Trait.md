## **Conditions Leading to Increased Sickling and Polymerization:**

- **Severe Tissue Hypoxia:** Low oxygen levels in tissues. Sickle hemoglobin (HbS) is more likely to polymerize and cause sickling when oxygen levels drop significantly.
- **Acidosis:** Increased acidity in the blood. Acidic conditions can promote sickling because they alter the hemoglobin structure, making polymerization more likely.
- **Increased Viscosity:** Thicker blood can slow down circulation, leading to lower oxygen delivery and increased likelihood of sickling.
- **Dehydration:** Loss of water from the body increases blood viscosity and decreases blood volume, both of which can contribute to RBC sickling.
- **Hypothermia:** Low body temperature can affect blood flow and oxygen delivery, increasing the risk of sickling.
