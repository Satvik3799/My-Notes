I regret telling my parents about Paramee.
I wish I could go back and stay in those moments before I told my parents. Everything was so perfect. 
She told her parents about me. I should've carefully think before telling my parents. I should've told them after getting all knowledge. I rushed my decision, I should've trusted my gut feeling and not tell my parents until I had a job. Maybe I could've thought about something related to the Sickle Cell Trait that she has. 

What do I think about this situation?
I understand the practical aspects. I am willing to take care of her, but my brother is right. Family comes first, my mother will get affected a lot. 
What I think is..
She is a beautiful person. I never had a fake laugh in front of her. I have never been this much happier. Even if she gets terminally ill, I want to have the happiest time I can have with her. I don't like people around me, I could never get along with them, they never understood me and neither did they understand me. But she, she is different from all these people. She has such a pure heart, she never had a bad intention. If only my family could see, what I see in her. Its not just a teenage infatuation. She maybe not compatible with me practically, but we are compatible for each other. She understands me and I understand her. 

I am not ready to accept we cannot live together. I will do everything in my power to make it possible.


I NEED TO GET HIGHEST PACKAGE POSSIBLE. I HAVE A GUT FEELING, EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE AFTER THAT.
